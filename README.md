## 📘 What is BDD?

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** is a collaborative software development approach that encourages communication between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on **defining expected behavior** of the system through **clear, human-readable scenarios**, often structured as:

```
Given some initial context,
When an event occurs,
Then an expected outcome should happen.
```

These scenarios are written in **Gherkin**, a simple language that makes it easy to describe the behavior of a feature in a way that everyone can understand—regardless of their technical background.

## 💡 Why Use BDD?

Teams that embrace BDD experience numerous benefits:

- ✅ **Improved product quality** through clear, testable acceptance criteria.
- 🤝 **Better collaboration** between developers, QA, and business stakeholders.
- 🧠 **Shared understanding** of what features do and how they behave.
- 🚀 **Faster feedback loops**, especially when integrated into automated tests.
- 🌍 **Open mindset and learning culture** across the team.

## 🌟 My Experience

From my own experience, I’ve found BDD to be **easy to learn and incredibly impactful**. I’ve successfully implemented it in several projects across different domains, and every time, it has contributed to:

- Raising the **bar for quality**
- Encouraging **open conversations** about requirements
- Helping teams **think in terms of user value**, not just code
